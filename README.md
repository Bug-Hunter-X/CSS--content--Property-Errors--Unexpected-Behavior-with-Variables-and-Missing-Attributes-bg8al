This repository demonstrates a subtle bug involving the CSS `content` property used with `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.  The issue arises from unexpected data types or missing attribute values passed to the `content` property. The `bug.css` file showcases the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version. The bug is detailed in the `bug.css` file comments and involves a missing attribute and an incorrectly-typed variable.
