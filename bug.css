The CSS property `content` is used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to insert generated content.  However, if you use `content` with a value that's not a string, unexpected behavior can occur, such as unexpected rendering or no rendering at all.  For example, using a variable that hasn't been properly defined or an incorrect data type can cause issues.  Another problem occurs when using the `attr()` function within `content`  if the specified attribute doesn't exist on the element, this will often silently fail, with no content being generated. This can be hard to debug because there's no clear error message.
